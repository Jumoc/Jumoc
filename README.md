### Hey I'm Jumoc <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/4843/4843845.png" alt="Pug icon" style="height: 34px; width:34px;"/>

I'm a full stack developer with a strong focus on frontend magic. React.js, Next.js, and Node.js enthusiast ðŸš€. I wield React to craft dynamic and responsive user interfaces, infusing them with the latest web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. On the backend, I'm no stranger to the realms of Node.js and PostgreSQL, weaving them together for efficient, scalable server-side applications.

I thrive on integrating backend services and APIs to create seamless user experiences that sparkle âœ¨. My code? It's high-quality, efficient, and meticulously detailed, with an eye for perfection. A true team player, I collaborate seamlessly with designers, developers, and stakeholders to bring visions to vibrant life.
